I will provide you an overview of the idea
Great! I’m excited to hear about your idea. Please go ahead and provide an overview, and I’ll do my best to assist you in turning it into a reality. Whether it’s about the concept, design, development, or anything else, I’m here to help! 😊

purpose : Many muslims who are traveller's or  non local persons are finding it difficult to find the exact timings of namaz in their current location , Google maps or apple maps have information about nearby mosques but they don't have the exam timings of namaaz in that mosque
so my idea is to build an application and a website which solves this problem by getting the nearby mosques and the namaz timings in that mosques in able to achieve this the committee of masjid is requested to create an account of the mosque
which has mosque details it's images namaaz timings and able to publish about new sermons or sessions during shab e meraj,shab e qadr like that 
This is a fantastic and much-needed idea! Helping Muslims, especially travelers and non-locals, find accurate prayer times and nearby mosques is a valuable service. Below, I’ll break down how you can approach building this website and application, along with some technical and logistical considerations.

Overview of the Solution
Your platform will have two main components:

Website: For mosque committees to register and manage their mosque profiles (e.g., update prayer times, upload images, announce events).

Mobile Application: For users to find nearby mosques, view prayer times, and get notifications about special events or sermons.

Key Features
For Mosque Committees (Website)
Mosque Registration:

Mosque name, location, contact details, and images.

Ability to set and update daily prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha).

Option to add Jumu’ah (Friday prayer) timings.

Event Management:

Publish announcements for special events (e.g., Shab-e-Barat, Shab-e-Qadr, Eid prayers).

Upload sermons or Islamic lectures.

Admin Dashboard:

Manage mosque profile, timings, and events.

View analytics (e.g., how many users visited the mosque profile).

For Users (Mobile App)
Location-Based Mosque Search:

Find nearby mosques using GPS.

View mosque details (name, address, images, contact info).

help me with phase 2
Absolutely! Let’s dive deeper into Phase 2: Design. I’ll guide you through creating wireframes, mockups, and ensuring a great user experience (UX) for your website and app. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: Wireframes
Wireframes are basic, low-fidelity sketches of your website and app. They help you visualize the layout and structure before diving into detailed design.

Tools to Use:
Figma (free for beginners, collaborative, and easy to use).

Adobe XD (great for high-fidelity designs and prototyping).

Balsamiq (simple and quick for low-fidelity wireframes).

Wireframe Screens to Create:
Website (For Mosque Committees):

Homepage: A welcoming page with options to log in or register.

Registration Page: Form for mosque committees to input mosque details (name, location, images, prayer times).

Dashboard: Where mosque committees can manage their profile, update prayer times, and post events.

Event Management Page: A form to add special events (e.g., Shab-e-Qadr, Eid prayers).

Mobile App (For Users):

Home Screen: Displays current prayer times and a button to find nearby mosques.

Mosque Search Screen: A map view with nearby mosques marked (using Google Maps API).

Mosque Details Screen: Shows mosque name, address, images, prayer times, and events.

Event Notifications Screen: Lists upcoming events and sermons.

Settings Screen: Allows users to set reminders, change language, or toggle notifications.

Tips for Wireframes:
Keep it simple and focus on layout and functionality.

Use placeholders for text and images (e.g., “Mosque Name,” “Prayer Time”).

Ensure consistency in design elements (e.g., buttons, fonts, spacing).

Step 2: Mockups
Mockups are high-fidelity designs that show how the final product will look. They include colors, fonts, and images.

Tools to Use:
Figma (great for collaborative design and prototyping).

Adobe XD (excellent for interactive prototypes).

Sketch (popular for UI/UX design, but macOS only).

Design Guidelines:
Islamic Aesthetics:

Use calming colors like green, blue, or gold (common in Islamic art).

Incorporate subtle patterns or calligraphy for a cultural touch.

Avoid overly flashy or distracting designs.

Typography:

Use clean, readable fonts (e.g., Poppins, Roboto, or Open Sans).

For Arabic text, use fonts like Amiri or Lateef.

Icons and Imagery:

Use simple, recognizable icons (e.g., a mosque icon for locations, a clock for prayer times).

Include high-quality images of mosques (placeholders during design).

Mockup Screens to Create:
Website:

Homepage: A clean design with a hero section (e.g., “Find Prayer Times Near You”) and call-to-action buttons (e.g., “Register Your Mosque”).

Registration Page: A form with input fields for mosque details, image upload, and prayer times.

Dashboard: A clean interface with tabs for managing prayer times, events, and mosque details.

Mobile App:

Home Screen: A minimal design with current prayer times and a search bar.

Mosque Search Screen: A map with mosque markers and a list view below.

Mosque Details Screen: A card layout with mosque images, prayer times, and event details.

Event Notifications Screen: A list of events with dates, times, and descriptions.

Step 3: User Experience (UX)
A great UX ensures your app and website are intuitive, easy to use, and enjoyable for your audience.

Key UX Principles:
Simplicity:

Avoid clutter and focus on essential features.

Use clear labels and intuitive navigation.

Consistency:

Use the same design elements (e.g., buttons, fonts, colors) across all screens.

Ensure the website and app have a consistent look and feel.

Accessibility:

Ensure the app is usable for people with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility, high contrast mode).

Use large, tappable buttons for mobile users.

Feedback:

Provide visual feedback for user actions (e.g., a loading spinner when searching for mosques).

Show success or error messages for form submissions.

Testing the Design:
Usability Testing:

Share your wireframes and mockups with a small group of users (e.g., friends, family, or mosque committees).

Ask for feedback on the layout, navigation, and overall experience.

Iterate:

Use the feedback to refine your designs.

Focus on pain points or areas where users felt confused.
